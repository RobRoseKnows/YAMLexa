YAMLexa
=======

This is a script I wrote to convert a series of YAML files to a JSON file compatible with the Alexa skills builder.

I intend this to make it easier to define slots and intents in code that can be saved to a repository before being uploaded to Amazon's servers. I'll add more to this later possibly.

Other contributors are welcome, I'll write up some contribution guides later.
